HOW TO: DEPLOY TO MAEMO EXTRAS DEVEL

Step 1: Create debian package structure

	Follow the instructions on the following page:
	http://wiki.maemo.org/Packaging_a_Qt_application


Step 2: Modify debian/rules

	The debian/rules file generated by dh_make must be modified. 
	Open it in your editor of choice.

	Find line:
	APPNAME := something

	Replace with:
	APPNAME := speedfreak

	Find line: 
	dh_strip --dbg-package=something

	Replace with:
	dh_strip


Step 3: Add required dependencies to debian/control

	The required dependencies for Build-Depends are:
	debhelper, libqt4-dev, liblocation-dev, libglib2.0-dev, libgconf2-dev

	You can add them to the Build-Depends line, each dependency separated 
	by a comma. Be sure to check that the maintainer name and other details 
	are correct as well.


Step 4: Create source package

	Execute:
	dpkg-buildpackage -sa -S


Step 5: Upload

	Upload to Maemo Extras. You need a maintainer invite for this.
